<h1>Welcome to nanodesk</h1>

<p>nanodesk is a debian base linux "distribution". I put distribution in ""
becuase it is just a minimal debian debootstrap installation, which you 
can boot from a DVD or usb-stick and install it to disk, with well picked
packages I like and a customized jwm config. Taddaa - a new distribution. </p>

<p>Everything done with having the goal to consume as less ram as possible.</p>

<h2>install to disk</h2>

<p>You can install nanodesk to your harddrive. Before doing so,
you have to get your drive partitioned and formated. </p>

<p>Partiotioning on an empty drive is simple, you need two partitions</p>

<ul>
<li>partition1: ext4 , mainfilesystem. </li>
<li>partition2 (optional, but recommended): swap</li>
</ul>

<p>You can use <code>gparted</code> or <code>fdisk</code> for this. Please read their manuals.</p>

<p>This done, just run <code>sudo /root/install_nanodesk.sh /dev/sdXY</code> from the terminal
and the installation will start. (change /dev/sdXY to your drive)</p>

<h2>installing software</h2>

<p>There is no GUI tool for installing software. You have to use <code>apt</code> from the
terminal.</p>

<h2>getting root</h2>

<p>In the LiveCD mode you can just do <code>sudo su -</code> without being asked for a password.
Depending on your choice by the installation, you will have to enter a password,
when you created your own using by the installer.</p>

<p>So or so good old <code>su -</code> works fine as well, just type in the root password.</p>
