# nanodesk

nanodesk is a less resources consuming debian linux distro, which I made for fun and learning.
It's using jwm as window manager.

My goal is to have a (live) system which is very lightweight and usable too. This is for a VM where you need a basic graphical environment or for an old computer with less resources.

## Screenshots

The most important thing about a completely useless linux distro are the screenshots.
Here you go!
